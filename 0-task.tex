\paragraph*{Taskset:} \hfill\\
C-states \cite{ACPI2016} are an integral technology to improve energy-efficiency of modern processors.
This study shall discuss performance and energy characteristics of C-state transitions based on literature research, experimentation, and analysis.
It shall cover the following aspects:
\begin{itemize}
\item Summarize related work on the topic \cite{DBLP:journals/ife/SchoneMW15}, \cite{Wamhoff2015}, \cite{ACPI2016}.
\item Measure the power consumption trace of C-state transitions on an existing Intel Haswell system with advanced power measurement infrastructure.
\item The experimental setup should be built on previous work described in \cite{DBLP:journals/ife/SchoneMW15}.
\item The utilization of the cache (cost for flushing) and activity on other cores (resulting package C-state) should be considered as factors for the experiment.
\item Analyze the results and characterize the state transitions with focus on the time and energy costs for entering sleep states.
\end{itemize}
